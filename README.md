# Python-RegEx-Plotly

This Python project is divided into two distinct sections:

1. Part 1 is focused on the fundamental concepts of Regular Expressions, used in this case to extract the date of several medical notes. The date format varies, being this the major challenge of this section: how to create the less possible amount of RegEx expressions to grab all the different types of dates. 
2. Part 2 is centered on the application of Plotly library. The objective in this case was to explore different questions that could arise in the dataset and answer them using plots from this library.
